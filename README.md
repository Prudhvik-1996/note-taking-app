# Welcome to Note Taking App!

## Description
Inorder to take a quick notes either while on a call or when in a meeting, I’m sure there are quiet many apps on the play store and the app store but nothing is as easy to use and effective as our app.

The focus of my app is to have a clean and minimalistic UI for note taking.

The app should provide an easy way to maintain notes, lists and ideas.

One should just launch the app, type some notes and they should be done, while being able to start where they stopped easily.

One should also be able to categorize the notes with custom color codes for each note.

## Why Note Taking App?
Out there in the market, there are a lot of apps, but either one has a lot of ads or one has clumsy UI or one has a lot of features (taking too much size), but none which satisfies all my requirements. Hence I thought, why not build my own…
